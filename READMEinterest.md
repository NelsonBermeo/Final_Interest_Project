# Interest Project

This is my interest project for codeacademy. The purpose of this project is to teach the user simple interest equations. 

Here is a link to my dev.io post where I wrote about what I took away from the project: https://dev.to/nelson_bermeo/interest-python-project-27fd

Blogging is important to reflect on your projects and also a place to learn lots of new information. I like it.
